SUMMARY
-------

IBEX Limited ([IBEX](https://www.fool.com/quote/nasdaq/ibex/)0.03%) delivered record results for the fiscal first quarter ended Sept. 30, 2025, including double-digit revenue growth, underpinned by sharp expansion in digital and offshore services and increased client diversification. Sequential improvement in working capital and reductions in share count and tax rate further lifted EPS, while stronger operating leverage offset gross margin headwinds tied to training investments and the India ramp. Management attributed market share gains and premium retention rates to differentiated technology capabilities, elevated client engagement, and successful execution of AI-driven operational strategies.

*   CEO Dechant underscored that recent AI investments have yet to materially impact financials but positioned IBEX for future margin expansion and competitive advantage.

Full Conference Call Transcript
-------------------------------

**Bob Dechant:** Thanks, Mike. Good afternoon. And thank you all for joining us today as we share our first quarter fiscal year 2026 results. Before I speak to our first quarter results, I want to start by saying that our thoughts and prayers are with the people of Jamaica who are dealing with the devastation left behind by Hurricane Melissa. I would also like to say how proud I am of our IBEX Jamaica team who has shown enormous courage and resilience through this tragedy and have worked tirelessly to care for our employees while getting us operational within 24 hours of the hurricane in our Portmore and Kingston sites. And as of Monday this week, in our Ocho Rios site.

I would also like to highlight the great support we have received from our clients who have offered assistance alongside our IBEX CARES Initiatives to help those who are significantly impacted. Lastly, the BPO community in Jamaica is a tight-knit community, and our thoughts and prayers go out to our Jamaican BPO peers and their people.

I am pleased to report that IBEX carried the momentum we built throughout fiscal 2025 into 2026, delivering an outstanding first quarter with revenue growth of 16.5% and adjusted EPS growth of 74% as we continue to separate ourselves from the pack in the BPO market. Our sustained double-digit revenue growth highlights our competitive differentiation in the CX space. We continue to drive exceptional operational delivery for our existing clients enabling us to win significant market share from our competition. I am equally proud of our new logo engine that continues to win trophy clients, positioning us well for continued growth and margin expansion.

And I'm excited about the progress we have made in our AI automate and translation deployments for our clients. Collectively, this continues to validate our position as a leader in the CX space.

Q1 was a very strong quarter. Even more impressive is the performance we continue to stack quarter over quarter leading to powerful momentum into the balance of FY 2026. Over the last twelve months, our results have shown explosive double-digit organic revenue growth, which is well above market growth. Consistent margin expansion and significant growth in EPS and free cash flow. For the last twelve months, we delivered organic revenue growth of 13% to a record $580 million. We grew gross margin 14% or 40 basis points, fueled in large part by revenue growth approaching 20% in our high margin offshore regions and digital-first services.

We delivered record adjusted EBITDA of nearly $76 million for the trailing twelve months, up more than 13% from the prior twelve-month period, while making key investments for future growth and differentiation. We achieved record adjusted EPS of $3.17, up more than 40% from the prior trailing twelve months. And we posted free cash flow of over $31 million, up from $25 million in the prior twelve months, while investing meaningful CapEx in support of our growth.

These results are an output of our sizable and distinct competitive differentiation that we have built. And the strength of this leadership team to consistently execute quarter over quarter. Core to this differentiation is our best-in-class blend of culture, engagement, and branding. Our purpose-built Wave IX technology and integrated AI solution suite connecting seamlessly AI to human agents. And our deep analytics and business insights capabilities. The IBEX leadership team is able to consistently execute against these points, outperforming the competition setting IBEX apart as a trusted partner. This playbook was key to us delivering one of the most impressive starts to a fiscal year in our history, and has us well-positioned to perform throughout FY '26.

The IBEX brand is stronger than it has ever been. Highlighting this is our most recent employee Net Promoter Score of 77, an all-time high, and our client net promoter score of 71, up impressively from 68. It is important to note that anything above 70 is considered world-class. These metrics play a critical part in our outstanding client revenue retention of over 98% and validate that our competitive moat is deep and wide. These metrics are also viewed by prospective clients as best-in-class, giving them confidence in choosing IBEX as their go-forward partner during the RFP process.

We are very excited with the wins we have had in the last two quarters where over this time frame, we have won seven high-profile new opportunities facing off against our much larger multibillion-dollar competitors.

At the core of IBEX is our new logo engine, that continues to win trophy new clients. And our ability to land and expand with these clients. As compared to two years ago, our number of clients making up more than $1 million per annum in revenue is up nearly 24%. Clients representing $1 million to $10 million per annum are up over 21% during this same time frame. And the number of clients generating $10 to $20 million per annum is up nearly 67%. And the average revenue generated by clients with annual spend over $20 million during these periods is up approximately 14%.

This powerful combination of winning blue-chip trophy clients and growing significant market share with them parlayed with our outstanding client retention rates has us on an amazing trajectory of double-digit growth.

2025 marked the shift from proof of concept for our AI solutions to full-scale deployments for several of our key clients. We continue to invest in bolstering our team supporting this critical vector for growth. Most recently, with the addition of Michael Ringman as CTO. We are at an exciting time in the industry, with the intersection of AI and CX. Mike brings an enormous amount of experience in both areas and will help accelerate our leadership position. I am confident that under Mike's direction, our AI technology roadmap will help further separate IBEX from the pack. Coming off a statement year in fiscal 2025, I am proud of our start to fiscal 2026.

And I am confident that IBEX is very well positioned for success this year and beyond. With that, I will now turn the call over to Taylor Greenwald to go into more details on our first quarter results and FY '26 guidance. Taylor?

**Taylor Greenwald:** Thank you, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. Thank you for joining the call today. In my discussions of our first quarter fiscal year 2026 financial results, references to revenue, net income, and net cash generated from operations are on a U.S. GAAP basis while adjusted net income, adjusted earnings per share, adjusted EBITDA, and free cash flow are on a non-GAAP basis. Reconciliations of our U.S. GAAP to non-GAAP measures are included in the tables attached to our earnings press release.

Turning to our results, our first quarter results mark our strongest start to a fiscal year. We achieved record first-quarter revenue, adjusted EBITDA, EPS, adjusted EPS, and free cash flow. First-quarter revenue was $151.2 million, an increase of 16.5% from $129.7 million in the prior year quarter. Revenue growth was driven by vertical growth in retail and e-commerce of 25%, health tech of 19.5%, and travel, transportation, and logistics of 15.4%. And was partially offset by an expected decline in telecommunications, our smallest vertical, of 22.5%. Importantly, our fintech vertical reached an inflection point in the first quarter and grew 3.4%, and with recent wins, we are confident in the positive trajectory of fintech going forward.

Our focused efforts to grow our higher margin delivery locations and services continue to have a favorable impact on bottom-line results. We are really excited that we are winning in all markets and, as a result, growing revenue in all geographies. Our highest margin offshore revenues grew 20% in the quarter, our nearshore locations grew 7%, and our onshore region grew 21% driven by growth of our high-margin digital acquisition services. Revenue mix in our higher margin digital and omnichannel services continues to strengthen, growing 25% to 82% of our total revenue, versus the prior year quarter.

We expect that we will continue to be successful driving growth in these higher margin services and regions, as we continue to land and expand new clients from our strong pipeline, as well as win further share with our embedded base clients.

First-quarter net income increased to $12 million compared to $7.5 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was primarily driven by the meaningful growth of work in higher margin offshore regions of 19.5% and operating leverage gained from SG&A expenses as they went from 20.2% to 17.5% of revenue. Fully diluted EPS was $0.82, up from $0.43 in the prior year quarter. Contributing to the EPS growth was the impact from fewer diluted shares outstanding as a result of our ongoing share repurchase program, and a lower tax rate. Diluted shares for the quarter were 14.6 million versus 17.5 million one year ago.

Our tax rate was 11% versus 21% in the prior year, due to a discrete tax benefit related to stock-based compensation. We expect our effective tax rate before discrete items to remain consistent at 20 to 22% for the remaining quarters.

Moving to non-GAAP measures, adjusted EBITDA increased 24.9% to $19.5 million or 12.9% of revenue, from $15.6 million or 12% of revenue for the same period last year. The 90 basis point improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin was primarily driven by growth in our higher margin offshore locations during recent years, and stronger operating results. Adjusted net income increased to $13.1 million from $9 million in the prior year quarter. Non-GAAP fully diluted adjusted earnings per share increased 74.1% to $0.90 from $0.52 in the prior year quarter.

Over the last several years, as a company, we are pleased with the client diversification we have established. For 2026, our largest client accounted for 10% of revenue, and our top five, top 10, and top 25 client concentrations represented 37%, 55%, and 79% of overall revenue, respectively, as compared to 36%, 51%, and 77% of overall revenue in the prior year, representative of a well-diversified client portfolio.

Pushing to our verticals, retail and e-commerce increased to 26.3% versus 24.5% in the prior year quarter. Health tech increased to 14.5% of first-quarter revenue, versus 14.1% in the prior year quarter. And travel, transportation, and logistics remained relatively flat at 14.1% in the quarter. These results were driven by continued growth in multiple offshore geographies and our continued ability to win significant new clients in these verticals. Conversely, our exposure to the telecommunications vertical decreased to 10.2% of revenue for the quarter, versus 15.4% in the prior year quarter as we see lower volume from legacy carriers.

Revenues from the fintech vertical represented 11% versus 12.4% of the prior year quarter, though, as I mentioned earlier, grew 3.4% year over year and 0.8% sequentially, marking a return to growth and the lapping of prior impacts we had noted at fiscal year-end.

Moving to cash flow, net cash generated from operating activities increased to $15.7 million for 2026, compared to $7.8 million for the prior year quarter. The increase in net cash inflow from operating activities was primarily due to higher revenues, which drove increased profitability as well as a lower use of working capital. We have seen a notable improvement in our days sales outstanding with DSOs for the quarter at 71 days, down from 75 days a year ago and 72 days as of June 30. We expect our DSOs to remain relatively stable on a go-forward basis.

Capital expenditures were $7.6 million or 5.1% of revenue for 2026, versus $3.6 million or 2.8% of revenue in the prior year quarter. This increase was primarily driven by expansion in our offshore regions that support growth in these higher margin geographies. Free cash flow was a first-quarter record of $8 million compared to $4.1 million in the prior year quarter. The increase was driven by increased revenues during the current quarter and the aforementioned shorter DSOs.

During the quarter, we repurchased 92,000 shares for $2.7 million. We have $10.6 million remaining on our current share repurchase program. We ended the first quarter with cash and net cash balances of $22.7 million and $21.1 million respectively, an increase from $15.3 million and $13.7 million as of June 30, 2025.

To summarize our 2026, we achieved outstanding revenue growth and profitability, once again allowing us to build on our existing momentum entering the fiscal year. Our revenue growth drove increased operating leverage and positioned us to post record first-quarter adjusted EBITDA margin of 12.9%, adjusted EPS of $0.90, and free cash flow of $8 million. Our continued strong financial results and healthy balance sheet are enabling strategic investments in our growing AI capabilities, sales resources, as well as further expansion in the strategic markets and in our top-performing geographies. Importantly, with our outstanding start to the fiscal year, we have the confidence in our business to raise our revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for fiscal year 2026.

For fiscal year 2026, revenue is expected to be in the range of $605 million to $620 million, up from $590 million to $610 million. Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $78 million to $81 million, up from $75 million to $79 million, and capital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $20 million to $25 million. Our business is well-positioned for today and the years ahead, and we are excited about the future of IBEX as we head into 2026 and beyond. With that, Bob and I will now take questions. Operator, please open the line.

**Operator:** Thank you. As a reminder to ask a question, please press 11 on your telephone and wait for your name to be announced. To withdraw your question, please press 11 again. One moment for questions. Our first question comes from David Koning with Baird. You may proceed.

**David Koning:** Yes. Hey, guys. Great job again and doing exactly what you said, winning share with some of the new offerings. So congrats on all that.

**Bob Dechant:** Well, thanks, Dave. Yeah. We are really proud of the quarter, proud of the role we are on.

**David Koning:** Yeah. Yeah. Great. Well, and maybe first off, you know, what have you seen? You know, we have had this GenAI, you know, kinda swirling around for really a few years now. And is it becoming a catalyst both for the industry and for you guys or more for you than the industry? Or you know, maybe talk a little bit and maybe also just add in how much revenue is it now and maybe where is it going in a few years?

**Bob Dechant:** Sure. So let me kinda break those up into two parts, Dave, if that's okay. You know, when I look at through the IBEX lens, the whole AI, you know, the excitement and also the, you know, the risks that, you know, people have talked about this relative to this industry, I think for IBEX, it's been all positive. And let me explain on that a little bit. We have leaned in harder, faster, I believe, than anybody in the industry on AI. And that's I would say there's two dimensions to that.

One, where we are AI internally to help us execute better, to provide tools and capabilities for agents to deliver better for teams to run the business more effectively, efficiently, and drive better performance on our client KPIs. We're further along than anybody, and that's why I think one of the reasons we continue to outperform and then take significant market share. So that is a boom for IBEX because of what we are doing above and beyond anybody else.

On the other side, the second dimension, I look as the more around using AI for customer experiences. Right, where you automate experiences AI for language translation, etcetera. Again, I think that we have leaned further into that than anybody else. We're not afraid of what that might do to our business. I feel like much of the market is very cautious and hesitant about leaning in. We're leaning in and our clients are seeing that we have a unique end-to-end model that really goes from AI all the way through to a human agent to provide an integrated and seamless solution for them. To me, I think that puts us in a really ideal position.

And when clients are making decisions, they look at that and they say, this is the type of partner that we want because not only can they execute today on the BPO side, but they're looking forward, and they're future-proofed, basically, in their model. They can we can grow and evolve with them as AI gets deployed more. So it's a real competitive advantage for us, Dave. And, you know, I believe that you know, that's something that is when you look at what our results are, when you look at the growth rates we're doing, the margin expansion, etcetera, I think that's an output of that.

Now to your question about how much of that is, we're still real early in the game. So, you know, it's not moving the needle on a whole lot of revenue and margin expansion yet. But, you know, but we're positioned well, and we expect probably by the end of, you know, fourth quarter of this year and into FY 2027, you'll start seeing that being another vector of growth and margin expansion that will move the needle for us.

**David Koning:** Yep. Gotcha. Thank you. It's maybe just a follow-up. Gross margins were a little down in Q1. And I think you're holding full-year margin intact. You're raising revenue, raising EBITDA, but margin about intact. Is that some of this a function of just all the investment going into AI? And I know you have benefits from offshoring, and AI ultimately is better margin, but maybe right now, it's a little lower as you invest.

**Bob Dechant:** Yeah. Taylor, I'll throw that over to you.

**Taylor Greenwald:** Yeah. No. Absolutely. So you're right. Our margins are for the year, we're projecting our EBITDA margin to be about 13%. So that's up a bit from the prior year. And what you're seeing what we're seeing is we're getting a lot of operating leverage out of our SG&A cost. Because we're able to hold our SG&A cost relatively flat while our revenue is growing at a much faster pace. So seeing good leverage on the SG&A line, gross margins are down a bit, particularly in Q1 and a bit in Q2, and you saw it in Q1. And really a couple impacts there.

One, whereas, you know, we're ramping in India, so still making investments and aren't at the long-term margins we anticipate that we'll get to in India. And then probably more impact in Q1 and Q2, it's a good problem to have. We have, you know, more wins, which mean more training revenue. And as you know, we defer the train revenue but experience the costs upfront. So we are seeing a little bit of headwind on the gross margin line on that as well. But long term, we feel very good about gross margin as Bob said, you know, the vectors of growth in terms of the off geographies.

And then once we start getting a more meaningful impact from AI should certainly have a positive long-term trend on gross margins.

**David Koning:** Great. Thanks, guys. Great job.

**Bob Dechant:** Appreciate it. Dave, thanks for joining.

**Taylor Greenwald:** Thank you, David. Thank you.

**Operator:** Would now like to turn the call back over to Bob Dechant for any closing remarks.

**Bob Dechant:** Josh, thanks. And, everybody, appreciate you listening. I'm really proud of this team, proud of the consistent performance quarter over quarter that we continue to deliver as we separate ourselves from this industry, from our competitors. I'm also proud of what they've been doing in responding to emergencies and, you know, issues like we incurred in Jamaica with Hurricane Melissa. And even in markets like The Philippines, there's been a whole lot going on there, with typhoons as well as earthquakes, and that team has my team has delivered and kept us amazingly resilient for that. I want to thank them all for that because they are the best in the industry.

And with that, thank you all for listening, and we look forward to talking to you next quarter. Good night.

**Operator:** Thank you. This concludes the conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.
